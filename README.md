# BioCheat
Toolbox for gene analysis
http://biocheat.wisewolf.org

It uses Flask, React.js, D3.js, Require.js and some open source javascript libraries.

Some features uses database. You can download at
biocheat_backup_20161214.sql - https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-ELLS_9v1eGSDAyNXZGNFV0NUk/view?usp=drivesdk

You can use without db but database is needed to full feature.

To use db, download database dump above and set database.
You have to create config.py at /biocheat/, same level with dao.py.
config.py sould
```
DB_USER= <user>
DB_PASS= <password>
```

After configuration, run main.py and rest_server.py both.
Then set reverse proxy /api/ to 8081 port and / to 8080 port.

**NOTICE: There's so many things to do alone. Every interests, contributes, opinions, requests and emails are welcom.**

### Base Skew Plotter
Tool for calculate and plot skew between two bases.
http://biocheat.wisewolf.org/base_skew

### Origin of Replication Finder
Tool for find ori position using GC skew. Scanning window will be fixed half of length of input sequence.

### Exon Intron Finder
Using exon's spectral property that has peak at (2/3)Ï€ when Fourier transformed. It uses DCT to spectral analysis.
